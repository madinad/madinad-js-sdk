Madinad Javascript SDK

### Integration Steps
1) Request from your Madinad account manager the unique website ID for your website. If you manage multiple websites, you should request multiple IDs, one for each website.

2) Copy the following snippet on your website's header:
```
<script src="http://madinad-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static/madinadsdk-latest.js?a=<unique website id>"
  type="text/javascript">
</script>
```
Remember to replace the equivalent part with your unique website ID.

3) Ready to serve ads.
